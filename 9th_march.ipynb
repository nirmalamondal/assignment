    "Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain withan example.\n",
    "'''The PMF is a function that describes the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. For discrete random variables, the PMF is represented by a table, graph, or formula that assigns probabilities to each possible value the variable can take.\n",
    "Consider a fair six-sided die. The random variable X represents the outcome of rolling the die. The PMF of this random variable is given by:\n",
    "P(X=x)= 1/6, where x=1,2,3,4,5,6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is a function used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. It represents the likelihood of the variable \n",
    "taking on a particular value within a range. Unlike the PMF for discrete variables, the PDF doesn't give the probability at a specific value but \n",
    "rather the probability density at that value.\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable Y representing the heights of adult individuals. Let's assume the heights follow a normal distribution with a \n",
    "mean of 170 cm and a standard deviation of 10 cm. \n",
    "The PDF of the normal distribution for heights shows the relative likelihood of observing different heights. For example, it indicates that heights\n",
    "closer to the mean (170 cm) are more likely to occur than those farther away.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "'''The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal \n",
    "to a given value. It's applicable to both discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "Consider a continuous random variable Y representing the heights of adults following a normal distribution with a mean of 170 cm and a standard\n",
    "deviation of 10 cm. The CDF F(y) at a specific height, say y=180 cm, would indicate the probability that a randomly selected individual has a height \n",

    "Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "''' the mean determines the central position and symmetry of the normal distribution, while the standard deviation controls the spread or variability\n",

    "Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "'''The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success (typically\n",
    "denoted as 1) and failure (typically denoted as 0). It is named after Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli.\n",

    "Consider a single coin flip. Let X be a random variable that represents the outcome of the coin flip, where getting heads is considered a success (1) \n",
    "and getting tails is considered a failure (0). If the probability of getting heads (p) is 0.5 for a fair coin, then X follows a Bernoulli distribution\n",
