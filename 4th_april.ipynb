    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It builds a tree-like model of\n",
    "decisions based on features in the data and their corresponding target labels. The primary goal of the decision tree classifier is to create a model\n",
    "that can be used to make predictions for new, unseen data points.\n",
    "Here's how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "Step 1: Data Preparation\n",
    "The algorithm takes a dataset as input, where each row represents an instance (observation) with multiple features (attributes) and a corresponding \n",
    "class label or target variable.\n",
    "Step 2: Feature Selection\n",
    "The algorithm evaluates different features in the dataset to determine the most suitable attribute to split the data. It uses certain criteria, such \n",
    "as Gini impurity or information gain, to find the feature that best separates the data into different classes.\n",
    "Step 3: Splitting\n",
    "Once the algorithm identifies the best feature to split the data, it creates a decision node in the tree. The decision node represents a specific\n",
    "feature and its corresponding value. The data is then divided into subsets based on the possible values of that feature.\n",
    "Step 4: Recursive Splitting\n",
    "The algorithm repeats the process recursively for each subset created in the previous step. It continues splitting the data into smaller subsets until\n",
    "certain stopping criteria are met, such as reaching a maximum depth of the tree, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or when further splits do not \n",
    "provide significant improvement.\n",
    "Step 5: Leaf Node Assignment\n",
    "Once the recursive splitting process is complete, the algorithm assigns a class label to each leaf node. This class label is usually determined by the \n",
    "majority class of the instances in that leaf node. For example, if most instances in a leaf node belong to class A, then class A will be assigned to \n",
    "that leaf node.\n",
    "Step 6: Prediction\n",
    "To make predictions for new, unseen data points, the algorithm follows the decisions made during the tree traversal. It starts at the root node and \n",
    "moves down the tree based on the feature values of the data point until it reaches a leaf node. The class label assigned to that leaf node is then \n",
    "used as the prediction for the new data point.\n",
    "Step 7: Evaluation\n",
    "After building the decision tree, it's essential to evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or other\n",
    "suitable measures, depending on the specific classification problem.\n",
    "It's worth noting that decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially when they grow deep. To address this, ensemble methods like Random Forest\n",
    "and Gradient Boosting are often used, which combine multiple decision trees to achieve better generalization and predictive performance.\n",

    "Step 1: Entropy and Information Gain\n",
    "Entropy is a measure of uncertainty in the dataset. In the context of decision trees, it represents the impurity or randomness of the target classes \n",
    "within a node.\n",
    "For a given node, let's say there are K classes (K > 1). The entropy (H) of that node is calculated as follows:\n",
    "H = -Σ (p_i * log2(p_i))\n",
    "where p_i is the proportion of instances belonging to class i in the node.\n",
    "Entropy ranges from 0 to log2(K), where 0 indicates a pure node (all instances belong to the same class), and log2(K) indicates a completely impure \n",
    "node (equal distribution of instances across all classes).\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm aims to minimize entropy by finding the best feature to split the data in a way that maximizes the information gain.\n",
    "Step 2: Information Gain Calculation\n",
    "Information gain is a measure of the reduction in entropy achieved by splitting the data based on a particular feature. It quantifies the effectiveness\n",
    "of a feature in separating the classes.\n",
    "Given a node, the information gain (IG) from splitting on feature F is calculated as follows:\n",
    "IG(F) = H(parent) - Σ (|Sv| / |S|) * H(Sv)\n",
    "where H(parent) is the entropy of the parent node before splitting, |Sv| is the number of instances in subset Sv after splitting on feature F, and\n",
    "|S| is the total number of instances in the parent node.\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm evaluates the information gain for all features and selects the feature that yields the highest information gain as the\n",
    "splitting criterion.\n",
    "Step 3: Gini Impurity (Alternative to Entropy)\n",
    "Instead of using entropy, the decision tree algorithm can also use Gini impurity as the measure of impurity in the dataset. Gini impurity is another \n",
    "metric to quantify the uncertainty in a node.\n",
    "For a given node, the Gini impurity (G) is calculated as follows:\n",
    "G = 1 - Σ (p_i^2)\n",
    "where p_i is the proportion of instances belonging to class i in the node.\n",
    "Similar to entropy, Gini impurity ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating a pure node and 1 indicating a completely impure node.\n",
    "The information gain can be calculated using Gini impurity in a manner similar to what was done with entropy.\n",
    "Step 4: Recursive Splitting\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm recursively applies the information gain or Gini impurity calculation to perform feature selection and data splitting at\n",
    "each node. It continues this process until certain stopping criteria are met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of instances\n",
    "in a node.\n",
    "Step 5: Leaf Node Assignment\n",
    "Once the recursive splitting process is complete, the algorithm assigns a class label to each leaf node based on the majority class of instances in \n",

    "To make predictions for new data points, the algorithm follows the decisions made during the tree traversal, starting from the root node and moving \n",

    "prediction for the new data point.\n",

    "Decision Boundary: The decision tree algorithm starts by identifying the feature that best splits the data points into two subsets in a way that\n",
