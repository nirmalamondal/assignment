    "#Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods to address the\n",
    "limitations of these individual techniques. It is designed to handle situations where there are a large number of features and potential \n",
    "multicollinearity (high correlation between features) in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques:\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Elastic Net Regression extends Lasso Regression by adding the L2 regularization term. Lasso Regression uses L1 \n",
    "regularization, which encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients to exactly zero. However, when features are highly correlated,\n",
    "Lasso Regression may arbitrarily select one feature and ignore the others. Elastic Net overcomes this limitation by including both L1 and \n",
    "L2 regularization, combining their strengths for better feature selection and handling multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Elastic Net Regression extends Ridge Regression by incorporating the L1 regularization term. Ridge Regression uses L2 \n",
    "regularization to shrink the coefficients towards zero without forcing them to be exactly zero. It helps mitigate multicollinearity and\n",
    "reduce the impact of irrelevant features. However, Ridge Regression does not perform variable selection, as it does not force coefficients \n",
    "to be exactly zero. Elastic Net Regression, with its L1 regularization component, can perform feature selection and retain the benefits of \n",
    "Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Regularization Techniques: Elastic Net Regression provides a flexible and balanced approach between L1 and L2 regularization.\n",
    "Compared to other regularization techniques like the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Ridge Regression, or the \n",
    "adaptive Lasso, Elastic Net Regression strikes a balance between sparsity and coefficient shrinkage, allowing for better control of model \n",
    "complexity and feature selection.\n",

    "#Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1.Grid Search: Perform a grid search over a range of values for alpha and l1_ratio using cross-validation. Define a grid of hyperparameter\n",
    "combinations and evaluate the model's performance (e.g., using mean squared error or cross-validated R-squared) for each combination. \n",

    "2.Randomized Search: Instead of exhaustively searching the entire grid, you can randomly sample a subset of hyperparameter combinations. \n",
    "This approach is useful when the hyperparameter space is large, and exhaustive search is computationally expensive. Randomized search \n",
    "allows you to explore a wide range of values and provides a good balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Coordinate Descent: Elastic Net Regression can be solved using coordinate descent algorithms, which iteratively update the coefficients\n",
    "by minimizing the objective function. Some implementations, like sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNetCV in scikit-learn, automatically perform \n",
    "coordinate descent and use cross-validation to select the optimal values of alpha and l1_ratio. This approach simplifies the process by\n",
