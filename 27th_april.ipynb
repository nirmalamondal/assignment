    "'''\n",
    "K-means Clustering:\n",
    "Approach: Divides data into K clusters by minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points and their respective cluster centroids.\n",
    "Assumptions: Assumes clusters are spherical, equally sized, and evenly distributed. Works well on large datasets but requires specifying the number\n",
    "of clusters (K) beforehand.\n",
    "Hierarchical Clustering:\n",
    "Approach: Builds a hierarchy of clusters either by starting with each point as a single cluster (agglomerative) or starting with one cluster containing\n",
    "all points and recursively splitting them (divisive).\n",
    "Assumptions: Doesn't assume a fixed number of clusters. Captures the data structure in a tree-like diagram (dendrogram) where clusters at different\n",
    "levels can be identified.\n",
    "Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",

    "Q2.What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "'''K-means clustering is one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct,\n",
    "non-overlapping clusters. It aims to group data points into clusters based on their similarities.\n",
    "Working of  K-means Clustering:\n",
    "1.Initialization:\n",
    "Choose K initial centroids randomly from the data points (they could also be chosen strategically based on domain knowledge).\n",
    "2.Assign Points to Nearest Centroid: Calculate the distance between each data point and each centroid.\n",
    "Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, making them part of the cluster represented by that centroid.\n",
    "3.Update Centroids: Recalculate the centroids of the clusters by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each centroid.\n",
    "4.Repeat Steps 2 and 3:Repeat the assignment and centroid update steps until convergence.\n",
    "Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly or when a specified number of iterations is reached.\n",
    "5.Final Result:At convergence, the data points are clustered around their respective centroids, forming K clusters. '''\n",
