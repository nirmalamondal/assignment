    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "DIFERENCES:\n",
    "Sample Size and Assumptions:\n",
    "t-test: This test is suitable for smaller sample sizes (typically less than 30) when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be \n",
    "estimated from the sample data. The t-test assumes that the data are normally distributed.\n",
    "z-test: Generally, the z-test is applied when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) and when the population standard deviation is \n",
    "known. It assumes that the data follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization:\n",
    "t-test: It uses the sample standard deviation to standardize the difference between sample means.\n",
    "z-test: It uses the population standard deviation to standardize the difference between sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution:\n",
    "t-test: The t-distribution is used to determine critical values for the test statistic. The shape of the t-distribution is similar to the normal \n",
    "distribution but has heavier tails, especially with smaller sample sizes.\n",
    "z-test: The z-test uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) to determine critical values for the test statistic. The z-distribution has \n",
    "a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLES:\n",
    "1.t-test - \n",
    "Suppose the researcher randomly selects 20 students from each group and measures their heights. The population standard deviation for height is\n",
    "unknown. In this case, because the sample size is relatively small (less than 30) and the population standard deviation is not given, the researcher \n",
    "would use a two-sample t-test for independent samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "z-test - Now, consider a scenario where a quality control manager wants to assess whether a new manufacturing process improves the mean production \n",
    "output of a factory. The manager collects a large sample of 200 products produced using the new process and knows the population standard deviation of\n",
    "the production output from historical data.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "A one-tailed test, also known as a one-sided test, is used when the hypothesis being tested specifies a direction (either an increase or a decrease) \n",
    "in a particular parameter (mean, proportion, etc.).\n",
    "A two-tailed test, also known as a two-sided test, is used when the hypothesis being tested does not specify a particular direction for the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical region (rejection region) for a one-tailed test is only on one side of the distribution curve.\n",
    "The critical region (rejection region) for a two-tailed test is split between both sides of the distribution curve.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0)  is incorrectly rejected when it is actually true. In other words, it's a false positive.\n",
    "A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is not rejected when it is actually false. It's a false negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis (H0) states that the drug has no effect on the disease.\n",
    "Type I Error Example: Incorrectly concluding that the drug is effective (rejecting H0) when, in fact, the drug has no effect on the disease (the null\n",
    "hypothesis is true).\n",
    "Type II Error: Failing to conclude that the drug is effective (failing to reject H0) when, in reality, the drug is effective (the null hypothesis is\n",
    "false).\n",
    "'''\n",
    " \n",
    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of an event based on new evidence or\n",
    "information. It calculates the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of related conditions. The theorem is expressed mathematically \n",
    "as:\n",
    "P(A∣B)=P(B∣A)×P(A)/ P(B)\n",

    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "A confidence interval is a statistical range that estimates the true value of a population parameter, such as the mean, proportion, or variance, based\n",
    "on sample data. It provides a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall, along with a degree of confidence associated with\n",
    "that range.\n",
    "Confidence Interval for the Mean=Sample Mean ±(Critical Value * Standard Error).\n",

    "Let's say you want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean height of a population based on a sample of 100 individuals. The sample mean \n",
    "height is 65 inches, and the sample standard deviation is 3 inches.\n",

    "Assuming a normal distribution and using a Z-table for a 95% confidence level (which corresponds to a critical value of approximately 1.96):\n",

    "Confidence Interval=Sample Mean±(Critical Value×Standard Error)=65 ± (1.96 * 0.3) =65 ± 0.588\n",

    "Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the mean height of the population is approximately between \n",

    "Suppose a certain genetic mutation occurs in 5% of the population. A test has been developed to detect this mutation, and it has a true positive rate\n",
    "(sensitivity) of 90% and a true negative rate (specificity) of 85%.\n",
    "Given this scenario, let's say a person tests positive for the mutation. We want to determine the probability that this person actually has the \n",
    "mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "P(M) be the probability of having the mutation (prior knowledge) = 0.05.\n",
    "P(T∣M) be the probability of testing positive given having the mutation (sensitivity) = 0.90.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(¬M) be the probability of not having the mutation = 1 - \n",

    "P(T∣¬M) be the probability of testing positive given not having the mutation (false positive rate) = 1 - specificity = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.\n",
    "We want to find \n",
    "P(M∣T), the probability of having the mutation given a positive test result, using Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "P(T)=P(T∣M)×P(M)+P(T∣¬M)×P(¬M)\n",
    "P(T)=0.90×0.05+0.15×0.95\n",
    "P(T)=0.045+0.1425\n",
    "P(T)=0.1875\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "P(M∣T)= 0.90×0.05/0.1875\n",
    "P(M∣T)≈0.24\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the probability that a person actually has the mutation given that they tested positive is approximately 24%.\n",

    "\n",
    "The margin of error in a confidence interval represents the range within which the true population parameter (such as the population mean or\n",

    "Margin of Error=Critical Value × (Standard Deviation/root of(Sample Size))\n",
    "As the sample size increases the margin of error decreases because the square root of the sample size in the denominator reduces the overall effect on\n",
