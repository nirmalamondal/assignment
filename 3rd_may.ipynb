    "Q1. What is the role of feature selection in anomaly detection?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Feature selection is crucial in anomaly detection to identify and use the most relevant features that contribute to distinguishing normal patterns \n",
    "from anomalies. Selecting the right features helps improve model performance, reduces computational complexity, and enhances anomaly detection \n",
    "accuracy by focusing on relevant information.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q2. What are some common evaluation metrics for anomaly detection algorithms and how are they computed?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Common evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC), Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR), etc.\n",
    "Computation:\n",
    "Precision = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "Recall = TP / (TP + FN)\n",
    "F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "AUC-ROC and AUC-PR are calculated from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall curves, respectively.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q3. What is DBSCAN and how does it work for clustering?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): It's a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are \n",
    "closely packed, marking points in low-density regions as outliers.\n",
    "Working principle: It identifies clusters based on density and distance parameters, creating clusters from regions with high density while marking \n",
    "low-density regions as noise.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q4. How does the epsilon parameter affect the performance of DBSCAN in detecting anomalies?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Epsilon (ε): The maximum distance between two points to be considered as part of the same cluster.\n",
    "A smaller ε might lead to smaller, more localized clusters, potentially labeling more points as noise or outliers.\n",
    "A larger ε might merge more points into a single cluster, making it less effective in identifying anomalies.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q5. What are the differences between the core, border, and noise points in DBSCAN, and how do they relate\n",
    "to anomaly detection?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Core points: Points within a cluster that have at least minPts (a minimum number of points) within ε distance.\n",
    "Border points: Points within ε distance of a core point but do not meet the minPts requirement themselves.\n",
    "Noise points: Points that are neither core nor border points and lie in low-density regions.\n",
    "Relation to anomaly detection: Noise points often represent anomalies or outliers in DBSCAN.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q6. How does DBSCAN detect anomalies and what are the key parameters involved in the process?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "DBSCAN detects anomalies by labeling points that do not belong to any cluster as noise or outliers.\n",
    "Key parameters: ε (maximum distance), minPts (minimum number of points in ε neighborhood), and the distance metric used.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q7. What is the make_circles package in scikit-learn used for?\n",
    "'''make_circles is a function in Scikit-learn used to generate a synthetic dataset where points form concentric circles, which can be useful for \n",
    "testing clustering and classification algorithms.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q8. What are local outliers and global outliers, and how do they differ from each other?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Local outliers: Points that are anomalies within their local neighborhood but might not be anomalies in the entire dataset.\n",
    "Global outliers: Points that are anomalies when considering the entire dataset.\n",
    "The difference lies in the context of their neighborhoods—local outliers are outliers concerning a specific region, while global outliers are \n",
    "outliers in the overall dataset.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q9. How can local outliers be detected using the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "LOF: Computes the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors.\n",
    "Local outliers have significantly lower density than their neighbors, resulting in higher LOF scores.\n",
    "Higher LOF values indicate points with different densities compared to their neighbors, marking them as local outliers.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q10. How can global outliers be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Isolation Forest: It isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum \n",
    "values of the selected feature.\n",
    "Anomalies are more likely to be isolated in fewer steps, making them identified as global outliers.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Q11. What are some real-world applications where local outlier detection is more appropriate than global outlier detection, and vice versa?\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Local outlier detection: Intrusion detection in networks, fraud detection in transactions, anomaly detection in time-series data where anomalies occur\n",
    "in localized instances.\n",
    "Global outlier detection: Detection of rare diseases in healthcare, identification of extreme weather events in climate analysis, detection of\n",
    "manufacturing defects across an entire \n",
