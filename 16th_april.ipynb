    "'''\n",
    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that aims to improve the performance of weak learners (often referred to as base models or weak \n",
    "classifiers) by combining them into a strong learner. It's a sequential process where each subsequent model is trained to correct the errors made by\n",
    "the previous ones, thereby improving the overall predictive power of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting works by assigning different weights to the training instances based on their difficulty in being correctly classified. Instances that are\n",
    "misclassified by earlier models are given higher weights, making them more likely to be correctly classified by the next model. This process continues\n",
    "iteratively, with each new model focusing on the mistakes made by its predecessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind boosting is to create a powerful ensemble by emphasizing the patterns that were previously overlooked or misclassified. Unlike \n",
